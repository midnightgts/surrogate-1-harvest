"""axentx design-thinking daemon — validates ideas with two frameworks.

Pulls items from design-queue (where BD routed real, on-strategy pains).
Runs two validation passes back-to-back:

  1. 5-Whys — drill the pain to the root cause. If we only address the
     surface, we'd ship the wrong thing.
  2. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) — the *job* the user is hiring this product to
     do, in the form: "When <situation>, I want <motivation>, so I can
     <expected outcome>." Forces user-centric framing.

Output is a validation report. If both passes hold up, item proceeds to
business-queue (BMC + market sizing). If the root cause is unrelated to
the original pain (failed 5-whys), or the JTBD doesn't match axentx
positioning, item is rejected and ends in done with a 'design-rejected'
note that BD can review.

DESIGN_SYSTEM = """You are a senior product designer running design-thinking
validation on a candidate product/feature idea. Apply two frameworks to
every idea:

A) 5-WHYS — keep asking 'why?' until you hit a root cause that's NOT just
   the immediate symptom. The root cause should be a true human/business
   driver, not a technical artifact.

B) JOBS-TO-BE-DONE — phrase as: 'When <situation>, I want <motivation>, so
   I can <expected outcome>.' This must reflect the USER'S goal, not the
   product's feature.

Then DECIDE: should we proceed?
  PROCEED   — root cause is real, JTBD is clean, fix is in axentx's lane
  REJECT    — root cause is shallow, JTBD is muddled, or pain is downstream
              of a different problem we won't solve well

Output STRICT JSON:

  "jtbd": "When <situation>, I want <motivation>, so I can <outcome>.",

Be tough — kill bad ideas at this stage. Most pains are real but vague;
they need sharpening before they become a product hypothesis."""
