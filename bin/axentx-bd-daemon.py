"""axentx BD daemon — opportunity classifier.

Consumes pain-point reports from research-queue. For each pain, asks the
LLM to classify it against the active axentx product portfolio:

  Costinel  — AWS cost analytics + anomaly detection
  vanguard  — security / compliance posture
  airship   — IaC / cloud platform deployment + DevSecOps tooling
  workio    — workflow automation
  surrogate — Surrogate-1 (this entire stack — autonomous AI dev agent)
  (axiomops removed 2026-05-02 — its scope rolled into airship; never target axiomops)

Verdict: either
  EXTEND <project>  → pain is best solved as a feature on an existing
                      project. Item proceeds to design-queue with the
                      target project tagged.
  NEW-PRODUCT       → pain demands a fresh product. Item proceeds to
                      design-queue with project=null; the design-thinking
                      daemon will validate fit before BMC.
  PASS              → pain is real but not strategic for axentx (e.g.
                      consumer apps, gaming, hardware). Marked done
                      with reason. Saves cycles downstream.

Note: BD does NOT decide on funding/build/ship. It only triages signal
quality and routes — design-thinking + business + marketing daemons
each contribute their lens before any code path is started.

1. Costinel  — AWS cost analytics + anomaly detection. SREs/finops who burn
               cloud spend on misconfigured infra. Solves: surprise bills,
               unused resources, forecasting.
2. vanguard  — Cloud security posture management (CSPM). Compliance officers,
               solo devs who need SOC2-lite. Solves: misconfigured S3/IAM,
               drift detection, audit evidence.
3. airship   — IaC / multi-cloud deployment + DevSecOps integrated tooling.
               Devs shipping to AWS+GCP+Cloudflare without knowing 3 stacks +
               senior platform engineers wanting CI/CD + obs + on-call unified.
               Solves: deploy-once-target-many, env parity, replaces 6 vendors.
4. workio    — Workflow automation (think Zapier for engineering teams).
               Solves: glue between GitHub/Slack/Jira/HF without writing scripts.
5. surrogate — Surrogate-1: autonomous AI dev agent (this stack). Devs who
               want commits/reviews/tests/docs done while they sleep, on
               cloud free tier.
