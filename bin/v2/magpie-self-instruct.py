"""Magpie self-instruct (ICLR 2025) — generate 1M training instructions for FREE.

Method: prompt aligned LLM with ONLY chat template (no actual user prompt).
Auto-regressive nature → model fills in user query first, then assistant response.
Zero API cost beyond compute. Used to create 4M Llama-3 instructions in paper.

For Surrogate-1 v2 we run on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct (or 14B) via:
- Local inference if we have GPU
- HF Inference API (free tier rate-limited)
- Cerebras / Groq / OpenRouter free if available

Output: ~/.surrogate/data/v2-magpie-synth.jsonl (target 1M after dedup)
