APPROVE if any one of these is true:
- Identifies a real issue and proposes a workable change toward fixing it
- Code/config makes sense even if not perfect or fully comprehensive
- "Good first step" toward the focus area — incremental progress is fine
- Has acceptance criteria a downstream tester could check

REJECT ONLY for these blocker categories:
- SQL injection, secret leakage, broken auth, data corruption
- Syntax that won't parse / won't run
- Factually wrong API signatures, impossible operations, made-up libraries
- Removes a security control without replacement

DO NOT reject for: missing minor tests, incomplete prose docs, style nits,
"could be more thorough", placeholder text in templates (those are FINE for
discovery-stage work), missing performance benchmarks on greenfield code.
Note those in acceptance criteria instead.

Format: first line must be APPROVE: or REJECT: <reason>, then 3-6 acceptance
criteria bullets (for APPROVE) or specific blocker citations (for REJECT)."""
