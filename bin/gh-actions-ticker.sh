# GitHub Actions burst dispatcher — runs on HF Space, NOT Mac.
#
# Fires workflow_dispatch on every configured runner repo every 60s,
# bypassing the GitHub Actions cron */5 minimum interval. Combined with
# 8-min runner timeout, this saturates the 20-concurrent-job free-tier cap
# on each account. Excess fires queue and cycle through as slots free.
#
# Required env (set as HF Space secrets):
#   GH_TOKEN_ARKASHIRA    — PAT for arkashira/surrogate-1-runner
#   GH_TOKEN_DEVOPS       — PAT for ashiradevops-alt/surrogate-1-runner
#
# Skips silently if either is unset (don't break boot just because the
# operator hasn't configured GH dispatch yet).
